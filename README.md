First download/clone the repository to your local

If downloaded, then extract the content of the .zip file at a location.

Now open the xlxs file either in MS Office or upload it to google drive and open it in google sheets

After opening the file enter the last salary which you want to consider as a base for distribution into various categories and also enter any date, you remember when that salary was received.

Your salary will be distributed based on the percentage you provide for various categories, if NOT provided then distribution will occur as of below.

Your salary will be distributed into 50%(EXPENSE), 30%(WANTS), 20%(INVEST) rule of budgeting. And further distribution of INVEST will be done into 60%(EQUITY), 40%(DEBT or FIXED)

Save and close the file.

Now you are good to go to enter the new salary received by double-clicking the MoneyControl.exe file.

Once a new salary will be added to the system then EXPENSE, WANTS, and INVEST will be incremented based on the rule of 20%(EXPENSE), 30%(WANTS), 50%(INVEST) on the difference between the previous and new salary.
